# Documentation Status

High-level dashboard for the documentation pipeline. Updated after proposal merges, audits, and when emerged concepts are captured.

## Pipeline State

| Metric | Count |
|--------|-------|
| Active research | 0 |
| In-flight proposals | 0 |
| Merged proposals | 0 |
| System docs | 0 |
| Last audit | — |
| Specs generated | No |

## Research Queue

Recommended order for upcoming research. Adaptive — reorder based on new information, dependencies, or priority changes.

| Priority | Topic | Type | Depends On | Notes |
|----------|-------|------|-----------|-------|
| | | | | |

## Emerged Concepts

Ideas that surfaced during research, review, implementation, or discussion that aren't yet tracked as research topics. This is a parking lot — concepts can be scoped into the research queue, deferred, or discarded.

| # | Concept | Origin | Date | Status | Notes |
|---|---------|--------|------|--------|-------|
| | | | | | |

**Origin examples**: research cycle, proposal review, user ideation, implementation discovery, audit finding
**Status values**: `captured` | `scoped` (moved to research queue) | `deferred` | `discarded`
